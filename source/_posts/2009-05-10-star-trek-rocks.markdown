I'll keep this brief and won't include any spoilers. Out of 10 Star Trek gets a 12. The movie didn't just beat every last one of my expectations for the movie, it flat out obliterated it. I was really impressed by how much different it was from the old series, yet not. For those trekkie fans out there, you'll definitely notice the things that are the same from the original series & movies, and will hopefully like the fresh perspective and view that its taking to make it different from the past. Cheers.
