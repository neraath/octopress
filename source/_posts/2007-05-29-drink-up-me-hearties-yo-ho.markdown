The third and wonderful "conclusion" to the <strong>Pirates of the Caribbean</strong> trilogy was released last week, and I had the opportunity to take my wife to go see it two days after it came out. Suprisingly, the crowd at the movie theater was small, with the show being only 3/4 of the way filled. But, that's to be suspected with the college crowd almost completely gone for summer.

The movie is slow to begin, but quickly ramps up once the underlying story is presented. Then, when you least expect it, it hits the ground running with a nice full-town battle ensuing between allies (?) and foes. 'Tis unusual without the biggest character of the story, Jack Sparrow, present. Fret not, however, as his re-appearance is one of peculiarity, but undoubtedly reminds you of the Jack Sparrow you knew from the other two movies. 

As many people have claimed, there seems to be more battles and more fighting in this movie than in the past two. This, I can agree with, but likewise disagree with. The difference between <strong>At World's End</strong> and either of the other two movies is the complete interweaving of all characters that had been introduced up to the final movie. A lot of drama and arguing ensue, yet there's always the ever-so-often hint of humor. 

One of the more enjoyable aspects of this movie was the addition of more "traditional" things from the <strong>Pirates of the Caribbean</strong> ride at Disney. You hear more songs and see things that are oddly reminiscent of the ride, should you have had the wonderful opportunity of riding it before. 

Overall, this nearly 3-hour long adventure is one well suited for any Pirate fan, and in my case, I can only hope the DVD is right around the corner.

4.5 / 5 Stars
