Well, it was coming time to renew <strong>intellectualistic.com</strong>, and I guess I was getting tired of how long it was. So, I opted to try to see if something that defined me a little better was around.

True to the fact, there was.

<strong>chrisweldon.net</strong> was somehow available. I guess when I was searching for domain names for myself a few years back, I found that <strong>chrisweldon.com</strong> was already taken, and didn't bother searching the .net domain. Well, it was there, so I quickly snatched it up and have now applied it to the site.

So, anyone who's come here via the domain name <strong>intellectualistic.com</strong>, please update your bookmarks and brains to use <strong>chrisweldon.net</strong>. 

Peace.
