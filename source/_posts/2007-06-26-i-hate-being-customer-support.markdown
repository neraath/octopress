S,

I verified that she could. I sent myself emails from all of her 
addresses and they came through just fine. Can you please provide me 
some specifics of what error messages she is getting?
{% endcodeblock %}

The situation is that the customer was having problems sending emails outside of their domain via Outlook. I went on-site and proceeded to verify that every single one of them could send emails out (by sending to my domain). K's was one that I double checked.

So, when I ask for "specifics" and get a reply that says nothing about what I requested, I just want to double my rate for support and call it the "dumbass upcharge".
