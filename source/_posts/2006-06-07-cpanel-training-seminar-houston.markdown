I'm going to be on my way to Houston tonight to spend my Thursday and Friday sitting in an unknown environment learning about our beloved cPanel program. cPanel is nice - but I think I could make something better. There have been a lot of inconsistencies within the program as you move from one operating system to another, and not to mention I can't understand why they'd code for one O/S but not another (Debian). 

Anywho, I will be without my beloved, and will miss her dearly. But, hopefully this will give me a good chance to network with some people in my field.
