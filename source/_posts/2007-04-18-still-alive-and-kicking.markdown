Well, I know it's been a while since I've last updated, so I just wanted to let everyone know I'm still alive and kicking. I suppose I'll give a quick update as to my situation in life so nobody is left out of the loop.

On April 12, Melissa and I closed on our home! That's right, we're officially the <b>owners</b> of a new home! We're so excited and up to this point we've already done a massive amount of things to it - mainly painting. The living room is nearly done, one of the bedrooms is completely done, the office is still undergoing paint, as is the master bedroom. Keep checking back for pictures.

Recently I also changed positions within CIS. I essentially got a much needed promotion and changed to a new group, Customer Applications. I'm no longer working on Keystone like I used to - and I'm fairly happy about that fact. I'm working with quite talented programmers and I'm getting the opportunity to use some of the programming styles I've not been able to do for CIS for a long time.

Anywho, I need to get back to work since this project I'm working on is EXTREMELY behind schedule. I'll update again once we're completely moved into our new home! :-)
