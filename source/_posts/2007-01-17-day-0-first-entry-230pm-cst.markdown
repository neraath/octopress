<em>Introduction</em>

The next few entries into my blog are all about the Japanese honeymoon that Melissa and I were on from December 25th - January 5th. I originally wrote these entries in a leather book that I carried with me in my backpack, and I tried updating as close to everyday as possible. There's a lot to read, but I encourage everyone who visits my website to read the entries as you'll more than likely find them entertaining and/or interesting. 

<em>Entry #1</em>

After a long restless night (more than likely due to the excitement of going to Japan), we woke this morning @ 5:30AM. The weather was muggy and when we got to the airport there was a decent crowd of people in the lobby around the American Airlines' booth. This freaked me (and my father) out as it seemed as though the flight was cancelled - which was not the case. After getting through security fairly quickly and waiting in the lobby for what seemed like a few hours, we boarded and were in Dallas / Fort Worth airport before we knew it. The flight was one of the more turbulent ones, and I wish they would retire the prop planes for regional jets, but they won't. 

Onboard our 777 to Tokyo, we are 4+ hours into our flight. The lunch was manageable, and Nissa and I have been studying Japanese (along with combating sleep deprivation). Overall, I'm fairly impressed with the flight, and might consider AA again, but we'll see later on.
