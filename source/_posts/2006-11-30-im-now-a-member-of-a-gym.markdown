Yes, that's right - I've officially signed away my life for the next year to be the member of a gym. Will I use the darned thing? Probably so, believe it or not. 

See, here's the scoop: Melissa loves staring at Jamie Bamber's naked (oops, I mean half-naked) body. I'll admit, he's a good looking British stud, but I can't let him win over me with regards to looks! So, I'm "bulking up" - or at least trying to loose some of that pudge of mine and maybe tone myself a little better. 

But besides that reason, I actually am trying to get into the habit of going to the gym for an hour each day, doing at least half an our of cardio (or more on just cardio days) in order to get back into shape and make myself a lot healthier than I've been recently. I realize that in probably 10 years from now my health will not be in good shape if I keep up what I was doing (not working out, essentially). So, hopefully this will keep me alive longer, make me feel good about my body, and most importantly, make me <strong>feel</strong> healthier. 

It's a long road, but I'm setting my goals high. That's what you're supposed to do, right?
