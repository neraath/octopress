Well everyone, I'm finally back from a nice long vacation. If you haven't noticed, my last post was from quite a while ago. Over the course of the past few weeks I have gotten married to my highschool sweetheart, Melissa and gone to Japan for our honeymoon. Being in Japan with Melissa was truly delightful and a wonderful experience, and over the course of the next few weeks I will be taking the 50-60 pages that I wrote up about Japan and posting it to my blog. Additionally, all the photos that I took will be posted as well. So, stay tuned.
