I cannot believe i've never seen the first Star Trek: The Next Generation episode. Then again, it first aired in 1987, which would have made me about 3. I have to say, the later years were so much better!! the camera angles, acting, and music were quite campy in the first episodes. Oh, and Riker is really boy-ish. It's weird.
