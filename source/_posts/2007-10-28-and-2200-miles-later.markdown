...and I'm still alive and kicking. I apologize for the lack of updates recently. I've been extremely busy with homework and school, work itself, and family matters. The most recent family matter involved a distant cousin-in-law of mine and my wife's grandmother. Certain personal effects (mainly most of them) of my grandmother's were being held ransom by Melissa's cousin and had to be picked up for fear of being thrown out. Where were they? Phoenix, AZ. After a weekend of driving round-the-clock to and from Phoenix, I was extremely tired and to say the least, tired of driving. However, we managed to obtain Melissa's grandmother's personal effects and she was quite pleased. 

In any case, I wanted to briefly mention that I hope to completely revamp my blog within the next couple of weeks. A new look is coming about (an original one, for once) as well as a port to Wordpress. I've barely been satisfied with Serendipity, so I hope Wordpress will make me much happier. Furthermore, by being able to design my own blog pages, I should be able to make it adapt better to my code entries. Nevertheless, expect an update from me again within the next couple of weeks.
