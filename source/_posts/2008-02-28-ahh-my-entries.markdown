Okay, so apparently things didn't go as smoothly as I had thought they would when converting from Serendipity to Wordpress. Many of my posts took advantage of the "extended" posting feature (which basically required a user to click "Read More" and see the rest of my entry). However, the converter that I used did not convert these "extended" entries, so many of my posts are without content. I apologize for this, and look to getting them back up soon!

<strong>Update (3/30/2008):</strong> I've restored all of my old extended entries, so they're saved! Have fun reading!
