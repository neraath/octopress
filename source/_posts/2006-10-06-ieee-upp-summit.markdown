This past week I went to Piscataway, NJ to visit IEEE headquarters and converse with my peers from all over the United States. The event: IEEE University Partnership Program Summit. The goal: Allowing us to express concerns and needs from IEEE, network with peers, and learn much more about IEEE than we knew in the past. 

If you would like a short scoop on what happened (and see something I actually said), check out this <a href="http://www.ieee.org/web/aboutus/briefs.html#upp">article</a> from IEEE. I've got a more in-depth article from IEEE internal pages, but I need to make sure that its okay to post it before I actually do. 

Also, I'm going to post my review about the event when I have more time. Project deadlines, midterms, and administrative responsibilities have been killing me lately.
