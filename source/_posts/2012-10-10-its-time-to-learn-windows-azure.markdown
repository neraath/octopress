On October 22nd, I'll be presenting with several of our best Azure consultants at the <a href="http://www.improvingenterprises.com/events/event/windows-azure-developer-camp/">Windows Azure Developer Camp</a> at Microsoft's Houston Offices. <a href="http://www.improvingenterprises.com">Improving Enterprises</a> has been working on our Azure competencies for the last couple of years and have had <em>great</em> success at several customer engagements where we deployed solutions to Azure. These engagements combined with the <a href="http://www.improvingenterprises.com/about/people">amazing talent</a> we have here at Improving has allowed us to maintain our Microsoft Certified Partnership and become an Azure Circle Partner. In short, this should be an <em>awesome</em> <strong>free</strong> event.

At this event, we'll be having not only presentations, but <em>hands-on workshops</em> on the following topics:

<ul>
<li>Windows Azure Cloud Services</li>
<li>Windows Azure SQL Database</li>
<li>Windows Azure Virtual Machines</li>
<li>Windows Azure Access Control Service</li>
<li>Windows Azure Mobile Services</li>
</ul>

If you've always been interested in learning about how to make the move to the cloud, there's never been a better time. This event is <strong>free</strong>, and everything (food, drinks, the software bits) are provided. It is BYOC (bring your own computer), so make sure to install the <a href="http://www.devcamps.ms/windowsazure/downloads">Azure Camps Kit</a> ahead of the event! I look forward to seeing you there!
