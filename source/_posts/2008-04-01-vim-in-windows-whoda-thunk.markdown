A friend of mine passed over the following blog entry, which I found quite to my liking. J.P. Boodhoo (a leader in the .Net development community) has found some plugins and tools which enable vim in certain applications in Windows. Those being:

<ul><li>Visual Studio 2005/2008</li><li>Microsoft Word</li><li>Microsoft Outlook</li></ul>

Check out <a href="http://www.jpboodhoo.com/blog/GettinJiggyWithVIM.aspx">the article</a>. It's awesome.
