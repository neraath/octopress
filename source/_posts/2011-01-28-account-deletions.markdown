I had to recently re-install Wordpress. During the process, I didn't (forgot to) reinstall the registration plugin that helped prevent bots from auto-creating accounts. This resulted in a large number of illegitimate accounts being created. I've purged all of these accounts. If I purged one of your accounts that was legit, I apologize and ask that you re-register.
