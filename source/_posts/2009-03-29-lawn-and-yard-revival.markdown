Today marks what I believe to be the official first day of spring for Bryan/College Station. Despite the Spring Equinox occurring a little over a week ago, the temperatures have only recently begun to stablize above freezing, which is crucial for lawn and yard work. Anyone who's been to my house in recent months has seen the shape it's been in. It's hard, uneven, and as of late has been overrun with weeds (especially in the back yard). This year I'm going to do everything I can to get it into better shape, but not without the help of some local professionals. I'm going to post pics and tricks that I learn that show either amazing improvements (or horribly backfire) so that others who own their own lawns can attempt the same to get it as green and lush as possible.
