I seem to be surrounded by problems these days. <a href="http://www.zend.com/">Zend</a> has announced that Zend Studio 7 is now in Beta, so I figured I'd go give it a try since I was having so many problems with Eclipse being sluggish and overall a piece of junk. Yes, I know Zend Studio 7 is based on Eclipse, but I can't help but think that the slowness is a part of the PDT plugin I use for PHP development. 

I'm running <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a> Linux AMD64 on a dual-screen monitor utilizing Xinerama. I ran into a problem when trying to start the installer for Zend Studio.

Some initial Googling indicated that I needed to install i386 compatible libraries. The odd thing about it was I had done so - probably several months ago in fact. However, I ultimately managed to find the temporary solution on the <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6604044">Sun web site</a>, in that this was a Java bug relating to Xinerama. Basically, try running the installer on screen 0:0 instead of 0:1.
