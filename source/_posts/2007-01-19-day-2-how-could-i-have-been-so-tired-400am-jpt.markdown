I was so tired by 7:00PM last night that I was asleep by 8, throwing off my sleep schedule. Melissa was the same. Alas, I should probably describe my day before I return to the extremely hot onsen.

After my last entry we had about 45 more minutes on the Shinkansen before we reached Okayama station. This station was just about as bad as Tokyo station. It was busting to its brim with people. But, we definitely saw some really good eats there - it's a shame it was too early for lunch.
