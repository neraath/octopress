Many airlines have lowered their maximum weight restrictions, such as Frontier, to just 50 lbs. We found this out this morning when going to Yellowstone when Melissa and I expected to save $15 by using 1 checked bag (because each bag checked after <strong>0</strong> costs). However, this put us only 11 lbs. overweight resulting in a whopping $75 overweight "penalty". What ever happened to the good ole days where airlines didn't charge for checked baggage?
