As I sit here administrating the CS: Source server during the 12th hour I've been working for the IEEE LAN, I feel multiple things. 

<h2>Happiness</h2>

A lot of people turned out for the event, and everyone seems to be having a good time. We already finished the Halo 2 tournament and gave out the prize. Now the CS: Source tournament is heavily underway and people seem to be enjoying themselves. It was a lot better than I had previously thought it was going to be because I was having numerous issues with getting the game server setup and running.

<h2>PAIN</h2>

My legs hurt. REALLY REALLY HURT. Lack of sleep plus helping to lug massive amounts of equipment around has caused extreme pain.
