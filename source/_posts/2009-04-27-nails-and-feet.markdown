I was on a quest. You know, one of those quests of "I can save myself close to $200 if I can figure out how to fix this." types of quests. It involved trying to <a href="http://ycode.blogspot.com/2006/11/hp-2550-toner-empty-no-problem.html">replace the chip on my color toner cartridges</a>. My first attempt at replacing a yellow toner cartridge with a magenta chip failed (presumably because I scratched the chip). On my way back, though, my foot slipped off the little ledge in my garage and onto a box of nails - where one of them proceeded to go about half an inch into my foot. 

Needless to say, blood, pain, and some betadine was in order. On a positive note, however, my yellow cartridge is printing again - so it wasn't all for not. :-D
