Howdy y'all!

I apologize for my site being down yesterday evening. I've been switching hosting providers and there's been a couple of hickups along the way. Once I've verified that this setup should work for my business's customers, I will be switching them over here and myself over to the corporate server. So, in the meantime, the photos portion of my website will be down because, well, it takes a lot of space. :-P

Take care, and I'll chat with everyone when I return from Qatar.
