I've been working relatively quickly to try to get everything moved off of one of my servers in Dallas so that I can turn it into a virtual server. One of the things that had to go is my blog. Rather than hosting it inside of a VM (when the space, memory, etc. would be better sold), I decided to package it up and send it over to DreamHost. So far, my experience has been pleasing, and it was a surefire cannot pass-up-this-opportunity thing when they had the 777 deal - 1 year of hosting paid up-front at the amazing cost of $9.24. 

I'll be sure to blog about them on down the line. Not too much though - I'm still a hosting provider too. :-P
