Okay, so when I got into Work this past Friday, I was greeted by an email in my inbox asking about my sending of email over the weekend. Here's a nice little box that the administrator sent me:

{% codeblock lang:text %}
Host/Domain Summary: Messages Received
 msg cnt   bytes   host/domain
 -------- -------  -----------
 125555   288377k  HOST.tamu.edu
{% endcodeblock %}

<b>Background:</b>

Over the previous weekend I had established a really cool auto populating script that would help to automatically populate the Keystone test database with "hopefully" 300K+ emails so that I could have a nice amount of data to test Keystone with (as compared to our current test server with <800 slips in it - not a representative amount compared to production.

I'll post the scripts here in a moment, but this email didn't frustrate me. It was the email thereafter which did:

{% codeblock lang:text %}
Hi Chris,
	While it may add variety, it really isn't an appropriate use of the
University relays.  Please don't do this anymore.  You could have also
gotten variety by using aliases at a directly routeable host.  Thank you!

Much to his dismay, I ended up using several "local" aliases so that mail wouldn't be bounced off the relays. However, this weekend script (which was going to take 7 days to produce 300K+ emails) didn't go as expected, because the database maxed out @ 4GB. So, once I remade the database with the new limit in the dozens of Terabytes range, I needed to populate it really quickly. Thus, I ran about 20 threads of the script offset in 1 second increments with no more 5 second delay between processing. This started to populate the database VERY quickly, but also ate system resources like no other!

So, in all, about 700K+ emails were generated from my host, and as can be seen, 125K made it to the TAMU relays. My opinion: Big deal. The relays are used for sending messages out, and any administrator would realize that a "properly configured" (something that never happens @ TAMU) mail relay will be able to handle TONS of traffic. Additionally, WAY more SPAM goes through the mail relays (in the millions per day) than that and at least I was using the relays to actually do work, as opposed to appeasing my own hobbies. Thus, this should have been considered an "acceptable use of the relays". All in all, I don't like being talked down to by an administrator that has enough problems on his own trying to keep the damn relays from failing.

But, I guess one thing that's cool out of this entire thing: I beat out Facebook on the number of emails through the relay. :-D

<b>Scripts</b>

The way these scripts work is that it has an array of sources, from emails, and to emails to choose from. The "randomness" is really only pseudo-random numbers generated with PHP's <b>rand()</b> function. The sources, are <b>fortune</b>, <b>Local files</b>, <b>Cached News Stories from RSS Feeds</b>, and a few other things.
