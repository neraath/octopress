No, I didn't get neutered, for those of you with a sick sense of humor. I got my hair cut. How much? Let's say about 12"+, e.g. almost all of it got cut off. 

Why, do you ask?
<ul><li>I couldn't sleep right - I kept rolling onto it and yanking it</li><li>I hated how much shampoo and conditioner I had to use to keep it sane</li><li>I hated when I didn't wash it because I woke up late</li><li>I've been yearning for some sort of change</li><li>I felt like giving some charity - I decided my hair could go to a good cause (Locks of Love)</li>
</ul>

I'll post pictures of before and after soon.
