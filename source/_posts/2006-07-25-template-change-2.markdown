Okay, so I decided to change my template again. The reason for this was that my previous template was causing text roll-off problems in FireFox that I didn't want to fix. What eventually happened was I chose this theme, which had a width of 770px (because of static images), and ended up widening it to 1000px (yes, I had to edit the images to do so) so that my code examples would fit. 

So, in the end, I did more work than what I originally was not going to do. But, I guess I do like the changes more.
