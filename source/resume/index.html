                Chris was assigned to our office to work as a consultant on revamping the College's website through
                Computer Information Services (CIS). During the time he consulted for the College, Chris was very 
                attentive and in tune with the needs and wants of our office. At times, he was placed in difficult
                situations dealing with what we wanted aesthetically, and knowing professionally what was realistic.
                He had the skills and attitude to mesh both to make sure everyone was pleased. I did not have the 
                knowledge necessary to always explain what we wanted. Chris knew this and took great care in explaining
                all the options. It was a complete joy to have interactions with an IT professional who knew that I was
                confused and explained things to me on my level. The project continued successfully and the College
                raved on his expertise and service oriented attitude.

                Chris proved himself as an exceptionally talented analyst. He is super-intelligent with
                performances consistently exceeded what were expeted from his job title. As his immediate supervisor,
                I recall giving him high rankings and remarks in his annual reviews, and recommended a promotion
                shortly after he began working for us. I consider Chris in the top 3% category of all analysts I have
                supervised over my 25 years as a Senior IT Manager. Chris not only excels as a keen observer, a quick
                learner, a self-starter with a sharp analytical mind; he also shows "leadership,", uncommon for a young
                individual his age. Chris is extremely knowledgeable and savvy with new technologies; he posesses superb
                oral and written skills that enable him to express himself well.

                                When Chris joined the College of Architecture, the infrastructure was distributed across a myriad of
                                bare-metal and virtual infrastructure with no redundancy of services or adequate plans for high-availability, 
                                fault-tolerance, or redundancy. Chris worked with the IT team to revamp the infrastructure onto a hybrid of 
                                VMware ESX and Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V infrastructure, complete with NAS (NetApp) data storage. 
                                Chris performed information and directory services architecture while assisting active directory migration.

                    Windows provides its own level of challenges, but UNIX administration is largely a different beast.

                                Despite providing a significant amount of software engineering support, almost 50% of Chris'
                                responsibilities with Quicktate include dev/ops on our UNIX systems. Chris has moved the project
                                from inscalable bare-metal systems to highly available, more performant virtual infrastructure
                                hosted in Softlayer's cloud service. Though the original design and plan was to move to Amazon's
                                EC2, the cost of support in Amazon was not sustainable, leaving the team with Softlayer. During 
                                the transition, Chris implemented puppet to help automate the dynamic scaling of our web application
                                and front-end web servers to handle the roughly 15-20 million weekly HTTP requests and the 2 million
                                weekly voice transcription requests the site sees.

                                In preparation for the rollout of SharePoint 2010, compliance requirements dictated that
                                permissions and entitlements management must be tightly managed. To ease the burden of 
                                site administrators, a WPF application was built to provide a friendly UI for this 
                                entitlements management. The WPF application consumed a set of claims-enabled WCF services
                                (deployed within SharePoint) which performed entitlements and permissions lookup, 
                                entitlement requests, permissions modifications, and reporting.
